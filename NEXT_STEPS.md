## 🎯 Immediate Action Required (You)

### 1️⃣ Link to Railway Project
Run these commands locally in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Step 1: Authenticate to Railway
railway login

# Step 2: Link to your project
cd c:\proggggg\project-SAT
railway link -p b64abf5f-0974-4a4e-a9a5-329b921e000f

## ⚡ After You Link: Next Commands

Once `railway link` succeeds, you can run migrations and start development:

```powershell
# Initialize database (run migrations)
cd backend
railway run python manage.py migrate

railway run python manage.py createsuperuser

# Collect static files (for production)
railway run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```
