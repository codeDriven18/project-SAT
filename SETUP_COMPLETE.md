## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION (You Do This Now)

### Step 1: Authenticate with Railway
```powershell
railway login
```
→ Opens browser. Complete login in Railway account.

### Step 2: Link to Project
```powershell
cd c:\proggggg\project-SAT
railway link -p b64abf5f-0974-4a4e-a9a5-329b921e000f
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Project linked successfully
✓ Environment variables loaded from Railway
```

### Step 3: Verify Connection
```powershell
railway variables
```

**You should see:**
- DATABASE_URL
- PGUSER, PGPASSWORD
- PGDATABASE (railway)
- Other PostgreSQL variables

---

## 📋 AFTER YOU LINK: Run These Commands

```powershell
# Initialize database (run all migrations)
cd c:\proggggg\project-SAT\backend
railway run python manage.py migrate

# Create Django superuser (admin account)
railway run python manage.py createsuperuser

# Collect static files for production
railway run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

**Time estimate**: 2-3 minutes

---

## 🏃 LOCAL DEVELOPMENT: Start 3 Servers

Open 3 PowerShell terminals and run each command:

### Terminal 1: Backend (Django)
```powershell
cd c:\proggggg\project-SAT\backend
python manage.py runserver
```
**Expected**: `Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

### Terminal 2: Student Frontend
```powershell
cd c:\proggggg\project-SAT\student-frontend
npm run dev
```
**Expected**: `Local: http://localhost:3000/`

### Terminal 3: Teacher Frontend
```powershell
cd c:\proggggg\project-SAT\teacher-frontend
npm run dev
```
**Expected**: `Local: http://localhost:3001/`

---

## 🌐 Access Your App Locally

Once all 3 servers are running:

| App | URL | Default Credentials |
|-----|-----|-------------------|
| 🎓 Admin Panel | http://localhost:8000/admin | Use superuser created above |
| 📚 API Documentation | http://localhost:8000/api/docs | Public (no login needed) |
| 👨‍🎓 Student Portal | http://localhost:3000 | Register or use test account |
| 👨‍🏫 Teacher Portal | http://localhost:3001 | Register or use test account |

---

## 🚀 DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION

When ready to go live:

```powershell
cd c:\proggggg\project-SAT
railway up
```

**What happens:**
1. Railway builds backend (installs packages, collects static)
2. Railway runs database migrations
3. Railway deploys on auto-scaling infrastructure
4. Your app is live at `https://<project-name>.railway.app`

**Time estimate**: 3-5 minutes

---

## 📊 Project Architecture

```
Frontend (React) → Axios → Django REST API → PostgreSQL (Railway)

student-frontend:3000 ──┐
                        ├──→ backend:8000 ──→ Railway DB
teacher-frontend:3001 ──┘
```

**API Base URL (Dev)**: `http://localhost:8000`
**API Endpoints**: `/api/*` (auto-documented at `/api/docs/`)

---

## 🔐 Security Checklist

- ✅ JWT tokens (60-min lifetime)
- ✅ Refresh token rotation
- ✅ CORS restricted to configured origins
- ✅ ALLOWED_HOSTS configured
- ✅ Database connection encrypted
- ✅ Static files versioning (for cache-busting)
- ⚠️ **TODO for Production**: 
  - Change SECRET_KEY (currently default – INSECURE)
  - Set DEBUG=False in backend/.env
  - Use strong SECRET_KEY for production

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

**Issue**: "railway: command not found"
```powershell
npm install -g railway
```

**Issue**: "Project not found" during link
```powershell
# Make sure you're logged in to the correct Railway account
railway login
railway link -p b64abf5f-0974-4a4e-a9a5-329b921e000f
```

**Issue**: Backend won't start
```powershell
# Check Django configuration
cd backend
python manage.py check

# Check if port 8000 is in use
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
```

**Issue**: Frontend can't reach API
```powershell
# Verify VITE_API_BASE_URL in .env
cat student-frontend/.env
cat teacher-frontend/.env

# Should be: http://localhost:8000
```

**Issue**: "StaticFilesNotFound" in production
```powershell
# Ensure collectstatic was run
railway run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```
